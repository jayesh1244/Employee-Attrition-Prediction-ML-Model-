# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-ML-Model-
Built a Random Forest ML model to predict employee attrition (~83% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.88) using a 200-record HR dataset. Performed EDA, preprocessing (SMOTE, encoding), and evaluation. Delivered visual insights (feature importance, heatmaps) to highlight key attrition drivers and HR strategies.
